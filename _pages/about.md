Hello, I'm Zizhe Xia. Welcome to my personal site! I am 4-th year economics PhD student at Chicago Booth. I'm interested in mechanism design and information design.

## How to pronounce my name?

Zizhe is pronounced like "zi-zhir" where "zh" is a [retroflex consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroflex_consonant) that sounds like a "j", and "ir" sounds like in "firm". 

Xia is pronouced like "shia".

### **[Comparisons of Information in Moral Hazard Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12476)**

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four equivalent characterizations – (i) inclusion of polyhedral sets of feasible state dependent utilities, (ii) matrix factorization, (iii) posterior belief distributions, and (iv) classes of moral hazard problems. The column space order characterizes the comparison of feasibility in all moral hazard problems. The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.

### **[Screening Knowledge with Verifiable Evidence](https://zizhe-xia.github.io/files/papers/Hiring_with_Evidence_Feb2025.pdf)** (with [Sulagna Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/view/sulagna))

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A principal seeks to screen an agent based on his demonstrable knowledge of a subject
     matter, modeled as a binary state. The agent learns about the state through two kinds of
    opposing verifiable signals, each kind providing evidence in favor of one of the states. A good
    quality agent has an evidence structure which is more informative than a bad quality one. In
    a symmetric setting, we show that under the optimal test, regardless of whether the agent can
    predict the state correctly, he is failed if the amount of evidence he is able to show is below a
    threshold. Conditional on providing evidence above this threshold, the agent is passed based on
    a simple True-False test – i.e., if and only if he gives the correct answer. We see this result as
    rationalizing a common test structure where test-takers are given credit for giving the correct
    answer only if they show a minimal amount of data, arguments, or steps, in support of their
    answer. We prove the results by identifying a connection to the optimal transport problem and
    leveraging it to show the existence of an appropriate virtual value function.
