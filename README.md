## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Zizhe Xia. Welcome to my personal site!

## Who am I?

I am 4-th year economics PhD student at Chicago Booth. I'm interested in mechanism design and information design.

## How to pronounce my name?

Zizhe is pronounced like "zi-zhir" where "zh" is a [retroflex consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroflex_consonant) that sounds like a "j", and "ir" sounds like in "firm". 

Xia ia pronouced like "shia".

## Research

### **[Screening Knowledge with Verifiable Evidence](https://github.com/zizhe-xia/zizhe-xia/raw/main/assets/Hiring_with_Evidence_Feb2025.pdf)** (with [Sulagna Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/view/sulagna))

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A principal seeks to screen an agent based on his demonstrable knowledge of a subject
     matter, modeled as a binary state. The agent learns about the state through two kinds of
    opposing verifiable signals, each kind providing evidence in favor of one of the states. A good
    quality agent has an evidence structure which is more informative than a bad quality one. In
    a symmetric setting, we show that under the optimal test, regardless of whether the agent can
    predict the state correctly, he is failed if the amount of evidence he is able to show is below a
    threshold. Conditional on providing evidence above this threshold, the agent is passed based on
    a simple True-False test â€“ i.e., if and only if he gives the correct answer. We see this result as
    rationalizing a common test structure where test-takers are given credit for giving the correct
    answer only if they show a minimal amount of data, arguments, or steps, in support of their
    answer. We prove the results by identifying a connection to the optimal transport problem and
    leveraging it to show the existence of an appropriate virtual value function.

### **Expert Incentives under Non-Contractible States**
<details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    I study whether and which expert incentives can be provided at what
    cost when the states of the world become non-contractible, but there
    is some noisy observation about the states that can be contracted
    upon. A principal hires an agent to acquire costly information about
    the states, but it is not possible to pay the agent based on the realized
    states. Instead, the principal has access to a noisy (Blackwell) experiment
    about the states, and can pay bonuses based on its realization. I
    completely characterize what the principal can incentivize the agent
    to learn, and how to design contracts to minimize the costs to provide
    such incentives. I then study which contractible information is better
    at incentive provision. Under ex ante IR, the principal can achieve
    the first best cost, regardless of how noisy her information is. Under
    interim IR, only qualitative information matters for costs. Under
    ex post IR, quantitative information matters. I characterize novel
    orders that compare experiments based on their ability to provide
    incentives.

### **Regulating Monopoly Quality without Transfers**
<details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    I study the extent to which a regulator can correct monopolistic distortions 
    using quality and coverage regulations in the presence of asymmetric cost 
    information. I characterize the optimal regulations that maximize the weighted 
    surplus. When the monopolist tends to be inefficient, the optimal regulations 
    entail setting a minimum quality standard (MQS) coupled with the universal coverage 
    requirement. The monopolist is required to either provide some minimum quality to all 
    consumers with the possibility to sell premium services at higher prices, or leave the 
    market completely.When the monopolist tends to be efficient, the optimal regulations 
    set a quality cap for certain types. The monopolist is asked to either provide the 
    maximum quality for all consumers, or he is not allowed to serve qualities above a certain 
    level. If the regulator places enough welfare weight on monopoly profits, it is optimal 
    to impose no regulation. In general, the optimal regulations feature both an MQS and a quality 
    cap, and can be implemented with a regulatory menu offering at most three options. Additionally, 
    I show that the regulator grants more flexibility to the monopolist as the welfare weight on 
    monopoly profits increases.
